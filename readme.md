# Present.js
I made this bullshit for my friend so they could have a tiny websserver to get started with. this was a bullshit name that is probably already taken lol

## Instructions
- Download Node.js LTS and install [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Fetch from git  

```
git fetch <remote> <rbranch>:<lbranch>  
git checkout <lbranch>
```  

Github over https example:
```
git fetch https://github.com/icantrank/Present.js.git
git checkout main
```

- Run `npm i` to install dependancies
- Run `npm start` to run server, or `node index.js`, or `F5` in vscode (I committed a launch.json, and start script is defined in package.json)

There is a blank-template branch for you to go back to if you make a mess
